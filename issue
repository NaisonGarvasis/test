Issue: Clausematch Connector – Custom Content Not Accessible in Copilot Studio Despite Correct Schema
Overview
We have built a custom Microsoft Graph connector (via C#) to index Clausematch documents, where:

The source documents are in HTML format

We ingest both metadata and full document content

Data is successfully uploaded to Microsoft Graph

The schema is registered and includes all relevant fields

Key Metadata Fields (from schema)

new Property { Name = "latestTitle", Type = PropertyType.String, IsQueryable = true, IsSearchable = true, IsRetrievable = true, Labels = new List<Label?>() { Label.Title }},
new Property { Name = "documentUrl", Type = PropertyType.String, IsQueryable = true, IsSearchable = true, IsRetrievable = true, Labels = new List<Label?>() { Label.Url }},
new Property { Name = "documentClass", Type = PropertyType.String, IsQueryable = true, IsSearchable = true, IsRetrievable = true },
// HTML content (intended field, commented out)
// new Property { Name = "documentContent", Type = PropertyType.String, IsSearchable = true, IsRetrievable = true, AdditionalData = { { "isContent", true } } }
We also tested adding an HTML content field (documentContent) marked as searchable and retrievable — but observed the same issue.

Problem
When this connector is added as a knowledge source in Copilot Studio, the following limitations occur:

Only latestTitle (title) and documentUrl (url) are accessible in Copilot answers.

Other retrievable fields like documentClass, type, categories, and especially any HTML document content fields like documentContent do not appear in Copilot prompts or responses, even though:

They are correctly marked as isSearchable: true and isRetrievable: true

The data is successfully indexed and appears in Microsoft Search

Copilot appears to ignore or not surface custom content fields.

Attempts to Work Around
Ensured semantic labels title and url are set correctly.

Used a variety of field names (contentBody, summary, documentContent) with different formatting.

Escaped HTML content or replaced it with plain text — still no visibility in Copilot Studio.

Request for Microsoft Support
Is this an expected limitation of Copilot Studio knowledge sources when using Graph connectors?

Are custom retrievable fields (e.g., summaries or plain-text content) currently supported in Copilot Studio?

If not supported, is there a documented workaround (e.g., via plugins or custom actions)?

What is the best practice for indexing HTML content intended for Copilot knowledge grounding?

Environment Info
Connector Type: Custom Graph connector via C#

Source: Clausematch API

Content Format: HTML (legal/policy documents)

Copilot Environment: Microsoft Copilot Studio (public preview & commercial tenant)

Let me know if you want this saved as a .txt or .md file for upload. I can also help generate a minimal test case with schema + payload if Microsoft support requests that.
